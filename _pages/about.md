I'm a third-year PhD student at Tsinghua University, co-advised by Prof. Yi Zhong at School of Life Sciences and Prof. Jun Zhu at Department of Computer Science and Technology. Before that, I received the BS degree with major in biological science and minor in computer science from Tsinghua University.
My research interests include bio-inspired learning and continual / incremental / lifelong learning.
