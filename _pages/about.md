I am currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Tsinghua University. Before that, I received both the BS degree (Aug 2013 - Jul 2017, advised by [Prof. Yi Zhong](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1035/1105.htm)) and PhD degree (Aug 2019 - Jul 2023, co-advised by [Prof. Yi Zhong](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1035/1105.htm) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml)) from Tsinghua University, where I also conducted my postdoc research (Jul 2023 - Jul 2025, working with [Prof. Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml)). I have an interdisciplinary background in neuroscience and machine learning. My primary research interest lies in the development of bio-inspired machine learning methodologies and generic computational models for neuroscience. The current focus includes **continual / incremental / lifelong learning** and **transfer learning**, by exploring "**natural algorithms**" in biological learning and memory. I'm also exploring AI algorithms that serve other scientific domains. Welcome discussion and collaboration if you are interested in my research.
