I am currently a postdoc researcher in Tsinghua University, working with [Prof. Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) at the Department of Computer Science and Technology. Before that, I received the PhD degree from Tsinghua University (Aug 2019 - Jul 2023), co-advised by [Prof. Yi Zhong](https://life.tsinghua.edu.cn/lifeen/info/1035/1105.htm) at the School of Life Sciences and [Prof. Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) at the Department of Computer Science and Technology. 
I received the BS degree also from Tsinghua University (Aug 2013 - Jul 2017), with major in biological science and minor in computer science. I was a visiting scholar in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Jun 2016 to Sep 2016), advised by Prof. Yingxi Lin at Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I was a participant in Tsinghua-Huawei Large Granularity Long Term Cooperation Project (Sep 2019 to May 2022), working with Dr. Lanqing Hong and Dr. Zhenguo Li in Huawei Noahâ€™s Ark Lab.

I have an interdisciplinary background in neuroscience and machine learning. My primary research interest lies in the development of bio-inspired machine learning methodologies and generic computational models for neuroscience. The current focus includes **continual / incremental / lifelong learning** and **transfer learning**, by exploring "**natural algorithms**" in biological learning and memory. I'm also exploring AI algorithms that serve other scientific domains. Welcome discussion and collaboration if you are interested in my research.

I will be on the job market of 2025, looking for opportunities in both academia and industry.
